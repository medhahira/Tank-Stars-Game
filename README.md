# Tank Stars Game

This repository contains the code for the Tank Stars Game, which is a course project for the Advanced Programming Course at IIITD (Semester 3). The game is developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. The implementation also incorporates design patterns and includes JUnit tests.

## Game Modes

### VS Friend Mode

In this mode, two players can compete against each other.

- The fuel level of each tank decreases as the tank moves left or right.
- The player's health decreases, and an impact is shown when the tank is shot.
- The game continues until one player's health reaches zero.
- Players can visualize the projectile motion of the bomb before dropping it.
- Fuel helps tanks move and aim more effectively.

### Death Mode

In this mode, both tanks can move simultaneously.

- Each tank has its health that decreases when hit.
- The game continues until one tank's health reaches zero, resulting in its elimination.
