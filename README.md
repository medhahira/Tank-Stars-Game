# Tank-Stars-Game

Course Project for Advanced Programming Course (Semester 3- IIITD).
This game uses Object Oriented Programming concepts to replicate the Tank Stars Game.
We have used all the OOPs principles of inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and have also included design patterns and JUnit tests while coding the game.

VS Friend mode: is a dual player mode.
- The fuel is seen decreasing as we move the tank left and right.
- Player health decreases and an impact is shown when the tank is shot.
- Player whose player health reaches zero first, loses.
- The projectile motion of the bomb can be visualized before the bomb is dropped and fuel helps tanks move and aim better.

Death Mode
- Here both tanks can move simultaneously.
- The tank whose health reaches zero first, dies.

You can view the game flow using the VIDEOS folder.
